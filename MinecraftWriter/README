## MinecraftWriter
Takes a json formatted file as input and converts it to a minecraft world.

## Json format example:
```json
{
  "Name": "Example",
  "Gates": [
    {
      "Type": "AND",
      "Direction": "South",
      "Position": {
        "X": 0,
        "Y": 2,
        "Z": 3
      }
    }
  ],
  "Lines": [
    {
      "Position": {
        "X": 0,
        "Y": 2,
        "Z": 10
      },
      "Length": 8,
      "Direction": "North"
    }
  ]
}
```

There is also a complete example collection inside ./Example/example0.json
